- #L79-93 what are the numbers? Elliptical cut? Where do they come from? 

- #L96-110 what is the stitch weighting? Legacy2016?

- #L759 what does HHKonFit do?

- #L764-770 what are HTMax and HTMin cutting on? (it has to do with the stitch)

- #L810-814 we initialise the values of the couplings by hand -> going on we never modify this and we only check that the values are >=-990 
		-> is it because we are skimming and every skim is produced for a specific combination of couplings? 

- #L836-845 how does the reweighing technique work?

- #L906 what is the difference between reweighs and triggerbit+matching?

- #L979-980 what are this two? What file is it opening? Where are these files? (-> fct. definition #L134: what are the Trigger Counters?)

- #L1038-1040 which one we have to use? 94X or 102X?

- #L1062 in the 2018 there is a dummy file!!!

- #L1153-1286 I need to see the files to understand -> we are taking indices of stuff and storing them in vectors

- #L1290-1315 what are those




- #L1456 how does the CheckBit fct work?? comparing flag with 2^12, wtf?!

- #L1547-1549 standard way to calculate it??

* - #L1573 cf. #L1443 why DY asks also for MC and ttbar not?

* - #L1559 why TTtopPtreweight_down is not used?!

- #L1591 why fix abs=2 ?? 'Make sure that events with n_bJets == 3 are included in the n_bJets == 2 case' but why?

- #L1603-16011 what is this for loop doing?! what is the CheckBit fct doing? comparing flag with 2^13 or 2^0, wtf?!

* - #L1767 particle 66615 does not exist?!

- #L1893 what are the genHHDecMode? what is that strange calculation?

- #L1899-1916 strange way of counting events -> this EvtW is then added every time we match a certain selection to the specific event counter (ec)

- #L1926-1933 we do increment the variable for each bad thing that can happen and discard the event (#L1951-1952) if does not fulfil goodness criteria

* - #L1989-1990 / #L1997-1998 are the values for the cuts correct?

* - #L2449-2457 correct the values for 2018, what is the 2018 prescale? the ones written now are the 2017 ones

* - #L3062-3079 are the SF values correct?

- #L3219 why do we skip taus?

* - #L3223-3224 are the selections ok?

- #L3210-3281 third lepton veto is not vetoing?!

* - #L3370 why do we sort by deepCSV if we are going to use deepFlavor? we could be loosing the best deepFlavor scoring jets -> #L3388-3395

- #L3794-3850 what is this for?

* - #L4410-4430 dummy values
